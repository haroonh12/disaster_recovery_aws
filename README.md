I have the following architecture on AWS  
A. Primary Region (where the application is deployed):  
  -- Multi-AZ setup with Auto Scaling.  
  -- Load balancer distributing traffic to instances.  
  -- Database in RDS with Multi-AZ replication.  
B. Secondary Region (for DR):  
  -- Set up to replicate critical resources (dormant until a disaster).  

**Preparing the secondary region for disaster recovery**
A. Create the Secondary VPC
  -- Go to VPC Dashboard in the secondary AWS region.
  -- Create a VPC with the same CIDR range as the primary region.
  -- Create subnets (Public and Private) in different availability zones.
  -- Set up a route table with internet gateway for public subnets.

B. Database Setup
  -- Enable read replica in the secondary region for your RDS instance:
        - Go to RDS Dashboard.
        - Select your database instance → Actions → Create Read Replica.
        - Choose the secondary region.
        - Verify replication status and ensure the replica is in sync.

C. Create EC2 AMIs
  -- Go to EC2 Dashboard in the primary region.
  -- Create AMI from your existing EC2 instances:
        - Select instance → Actions → Image → Create Image.
        - Provide a name and description for the AMI.
  -- Copy the AMI to the secondary region:
        - Go to AMI Dashboard → Select AMI → Actions → Copy AMI.
        - Select the secondary region.

**Set Up Pre-Configured Resources in the Secondary Region**
A. Launch EC2 Instances (Dormant State)
  -- Use the copied AMIs to launch EC2 instances in the secondary region.
  -- Place them in the private subnets of the secondary VPC.
  -- Set up necessary security groups (match with the primary region).

B. Configure Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
  -- Create an ELB in the secondary region.
  -- Attach target groups that include the dormant EC2 instances.

C. Auto Scaling Setup
  -- Create Launch Templates using the copied AMIs.
  -- Set up Auto Scaling Groups with minimal desired capacity (0 or 1 instance).

D. Sync Static Assets
  -- Sync application data (static assets, configuration files) to Amazon S3 with Cross-Region Replication:
        - Create an S3 bucket in the primary region for static files.
        - Enable cross-region replication to an S3 bucket in the secondary region.

**Automate DR Process**
A. Set Up Route 53 Health Checks
  -- Go to Route 53 Dashboard.
  -- Create health checks for the primary region's ELB.
  -- Configure a failover routing policy:
        - Primary: Route traffic to the primary ELB.
        - Secondary: Route traffic to the secondary ELB if the primary health check fails.

B. Automate DR with AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery
  -- Enable AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS) for EC2 instances:
        - Go to Elastic Disaster Recovery in AWS Management Console.
        - Add your EC2 instances for replication.
        - Configure replication settings (e.g., instance size, region).
  -- Test failover by launching recovery instances in the secondary region.

C. Automate Database Promotion
  -- Set up an RDS failover mechanism:
        - In the secondary region, promote the read replica to the primary instance during a disaster.
        - Use automation tools like AWS Lambda or custom scripts to trigger promotion.

**Test and Validate**
A. Conduct a Failover Drill
  -- Simulate a disaster by stopping the primary region's instances.
  -- Verify:
        - Traffic is routed to the secondary region.
        - EC2 instances scale up as expected.
        - RDS read replica is promoted successfully.
        - Roll back to the primary region and validate replication.

B. Monitor and Optimize
  -- Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor health checks and replication metrics.
  -- Set up alarms to notify your team of issues.
