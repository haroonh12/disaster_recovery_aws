I have the following architecture on AWS  
A. Primary Region (where the application is deployed):  
  -- Multi-AZ setup with Auto Scaling.  
  -- Load balancer distributing traffic to instances.  
  -- Database in RDS with Multi-AZ replication.  
B. Secondary Region (for DR):  
  -- Set up to replicate critical resources (dormant until a disaster).  

**Preparing the secondary region for disaster recovery**  
A. Create the Secondary VPC  
  -- Go to VPC Dashboard in the secondary AWS region.  
  -- Create a VPC with the same CIDR range as the primary region.  
  -- Create subnets (Public and Private) in different availability zones.  
  -- Set up a route table with internet gateway for public subnets.  

B. Database Setup  
  -- Enable read replica in the secondary region for your RDS instance:  
          1. Go to RDS Dashboard.  
          2. Select your database instance → Actions → Create Read Replica.  
          3. Choose the secondary region.  
          4. Verify replication status and ensure the replica is in sync.  

C. Create EC2 AMIs  
  -- Go to EC2 Dashboard in the primary region.  
  -- Create AMI from your existing EC2 instances:  
          1.  Select instance → Actions → Image → Create Image.  
          2. Provide a name and description for the AMI.  
  -- Copy the AMI to the secondary region:  
          1. Go to AMI Dashboard → Select AMI → Actions → Copy AMI.  
          2. Select the secondary region.  

**Set Up Pre-Configured Resources in the Secondary Region**  
A. Launch EC2 Instances (Dormant State)  
  -- Use the copied AMIs to launch EC2 instances in the secondary region.  
  -- Place them in the private subnets of the secondary VPC.  
  -- Set up necessary security groups (match with the primary region).  

B. Configure Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)  
  -- Create an ELB in the secondary region.  
  -- Attach target groups that include the dormant EC2 instances.  

C. Auto Scaling Setup  
  -- Create Launch Templates using the copied AMIs.  
  -- Set up Auto Scaling Groups with minimal desired capacity (0 or 1 instance).  

D. Sync Static Assets  
  -- Sync application data (static assets, configuration files) to Amazon S3 with Cross-Region Replication:  
          1. Create an S3 bucket in the primary region for static files.  
          2. Enable cross-region replication to an S3 bucket in the secondary region.  

**Automate DR Process**  
A. Set Up Route 53 Health Checks  
  -- Go to Route 53 Dashboard.  
  -- Create health checks for the primary region's ELB.  
  -- Configure a failover routing policy:  
          1. Primary: Route traffic to the primary ELB.  
          2. Secondary: Route traffic to the secondary ELB if the primary health check fails.  

B. Automate DR with AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery  
  -- Enable AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS) for EC2 instances:  
          1. Go to Elastic Disaster Recovery in AWS Management Console.  
          2. Add your EC2 instances for replication.  
          3. Configure replication settings (e.g., instance size, region).  
  -- Test failover by launching recovery instances in the secondary region.  

C. Automate Database Promotion  
  -- Set up an RDS failover mechanism:  
          1. In the secondary region, promote the read replica to the primary instance during a disaster.  
          2. Use automation tools like AWS Lambda or custom scripts to trigger promotion.  

**Test and Validate**  
A. Conduct a Failover Drill  
  -- Simulate a disaster by stopping the primary region's instances.  
  -- Verify:  
          1. Traffic is routed to the secondary region.  
          2. EC2 instances scale up as expected.  
          3. RDS read replica is promoted successfully.  
          4. Roll back to the primary region and validate replication.  

B. Monitor and Optimize  
  -- Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor health checks and replication metrics.  
  -- Set up alarms to notify your team of issues.
